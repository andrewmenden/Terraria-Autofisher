# Terraria-Autofisher

`alt+l` to set the position it checks for changes
`alt+j` to start fishing (alt+p to pause)
`alt+c` to test the fishing position (basically just centers your cursor so you can see where the line goes)
`alt+e` to stop (only works when fisher is paused)

incase something goes wrong, in the console, spam `ctrl+c` to stop it
